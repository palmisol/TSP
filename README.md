# TSP - Travelling Salesman Problem

This Java tool was coded as an individual project and obtained an A+ for the _CS2004 Algorithms and their Applications_ module in the Year 2 of my degree in computer sciences. 

Travelling Salesman Problem is an algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points given a list of data points and the distance between each pair, only vsiting each set once and returning to the origin. This TSP tool for Java calculates the shortest path in each of the twenty seven datasets which have from 48 to 442 data points using the following algorithms:

* Random Mutation Hill Climber
* Random Restart Hill Climber
* Stochastic Hill Climber
* Simulated Annealing
