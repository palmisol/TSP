# TSP - Travelling Salesman Problem

This Java tool was coded as an individual project and obtained an A+ for the _CS2004 Algorithms and their Applications_ module in the Year 2 of a degree in computer sciences. 

Travelling Salesman Problem is an algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points given a list of data points and the distance between each pair, only vsiting each set once and returning to the origin. This TSP tool for Java calculates the shortest path in each of the twenty seven datasets which have from 48 to 442 data points using the following algorithms:

* Random Mutation Hill Climber
* Random Restart Hill Climber
* Stochastic Hill Climber
* Simulated Annealing

## Learning outcomes for the project 

* LO1. Understand fundamental issues concerned with computation and algorithms
* LO2. Describe and evaluate both classic algorithms and meta-heuristic algorithms.
* LO3. Successfully implement classic sorting, searching, graph traversal or non-population meta-heuristic algorithms
* LO4. Take real-world problems and identify relevant characteristics to guide the selection of an appropriate algorithm
